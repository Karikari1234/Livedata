# Livedata

This is a repository which shows through an example how we can combine **viewmodel** and **livedata** following MVVM architecture to better structure our code.
The main motivation behind this *code snippet* or I would say a demo android app is to show how we can **observe** livedata and work with them.

The Connection of the different components of the App is as follows :

             ->                ->
MainActivity     MainViewModel     FakeRepository
              <-               <-
N.B: **->** represents the flow of data.
